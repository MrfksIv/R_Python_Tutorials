# R Tutorials

My notes on some basic (e.g. import data) and more advanced (e.g. Object Orientation through R6 package) functionality of the statistical language R.


### Prerequisites

Have the latest R installed (3.4.1 at the time of writing). 
Package dependencies are explicitly shown in the code - you will see these as:
```
library([package-name])
```
If this fails, quite possibly you haven't got installed the specific package that you are trying to load.
Install using:

```
install.packages([package-name])
```
And then try loading the package again:
```
library([package-name])
```
